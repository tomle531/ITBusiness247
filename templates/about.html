  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    Hi! I’m <strong>Tom Le</strong>, an IT support technician with a deep passion 
    for both technology and tranquility. By day, I work in the fast-paced world 
    of tech—supporting users, managing cloud systems, and learning the latest in 
    Python, Flask, and Microsoft Azure.
  </p>

  <p>
    By night (and weekends!), I’m hands-on in the garden—building koi ponds, 
    shaping bonsai, and designing peaceful Japanese-inspired landscapes.
    I’m on a journey to live a simple, meaningful life in the U.S., blending 
    modern digital skills with timeless natural beauty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether I’m writing scripts to automate tasks or sculpting a rock 
    arrangement by my pond, I love creating things that are both 
    <strong>functional</strong> and <strong>serene</strong>.
  </p>

        I enjoy creating DIY pond systems—from pumps and filtration to lighting

        and joy into my life.

      <h4>🌸 Japanese Gardens & Bonsai</h4>
      <p>
        Inspired by traditional Japanese aesthetics, I work on shaping trees, 
        building mini landscapes, and designing natural spaces using rock, water, 
        and plant harmony.
